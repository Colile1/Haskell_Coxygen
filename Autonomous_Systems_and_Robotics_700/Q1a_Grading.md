# Question
1.a	Write a Python program that implements the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path for a mobile robot in a 2D grid environment. The grid should contain free spaces and obstacles, and the user should be able to define the start and goal positions. The program should:
•	Visually display the grid and highlight the optimal path found by the algorithm.

•	Handle cases where no path exists.

•	Implement the A* algorithm using a Manhattan distance heuristic for grid-based movement.
•	Allow the grid size and obstacle density to be adjustable.

•	Display the number of nodes explored and the total path cost.
