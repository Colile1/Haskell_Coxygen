# Haskell Chapter 15 Practical Tasks: Exception and Error Handling

## HC15T1: Handle Exceptions for File Reading and Velocity Calculation
Handle exceptions in a program that reads a file and calculates velocity based on user input.

## HC15T2: Self-Driving AI Car System
Implement a basic self-driving AI car system that reacts to traffic light colors.

## HC15T3: Custom Exception for Traffic Light Errors
Define and throw a custom exception for traffic light errors.

## HC15T4: Exception Handler for Traffic Light
Use a handler function to catch and handle traffic light exceptions.

## HC15T5: Safe Division Using Maybe
Write a safe division function using the Maybe type to avoid divide-by-zero errors.

## HC15T6: Safe Input Parsing with readMaybe
Use readMaybe to parse user input safely and avoid runtime errors during input parsing.

## HC15T7: Velocity Calculation with Optionals and Parsing Handling
Implement a program that calculates velocity using optional values and handles parsing errors.

## HC15T8: Division with Either for Detailed Errors
Define a function using the Either type to provide detailed error messages for division.

## HC15T9: Try Function for File IO Exceptions
Use the try function to catch file IO exceptions and handle them gracefully.

## HC15T10: Hybrid Error Handling with Either and IO
Create a velocity program that uses both Either and IO exceptions to demonstrate hybrid error handling.
