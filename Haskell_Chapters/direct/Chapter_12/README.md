# Haskell Chapter 12 Practical Tasks: Haskell Programs and Modules


## HC12T1: Print a Welcome Message
Create a Haskell program that prints "Welcome to Haskell Programming!" to the terminal.

## HC12T2: Add Two Numbers
Write a function addTwoNumbers that takes two integers as input and returns their sum. The result should be printed using the main function.

## HC12T3: Factorial Function
Create a program that defines a function factorial to compute the factorial of a given positive integer.

## HC12T4: First 10 Fibonacci Numbers
Write a program that calculates and prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using recursion.

## HC12T5: Palindrome Checker
Create a program that defines a function isPalindrome to check whether a given string is a palindrome. Use the main function to test this with user input.

## HC12T6: Sort a List of Integers
Develop a program that reads a list of integers from the user and prints the list sorted in ascending order.

## HC12T7: Calculate Circle Area
Create a function calculateCircleArea that calculates the area of a circle given its radius. The main function should demonstrate its usage.

## HC12T8: Merge Two Sorted Lists
Define a function mergeLists that merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list. Use the main function to test this functionality.

## HC12T9: Read and Print File Content
Write a program that reads a file and prints its content to the terminal. Handle errors gracefully in case the file doesn't exist.

## HC12T10: Mathematical Operations Module
Create a Haskell program that defines a module for mathematical operations and demonstrates its use in the main function.
