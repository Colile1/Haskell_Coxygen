# Haskell Chapter 14 Practical Tasks: Cabal Projects and Advanced Features

## HC14T1: Initialize a Cabal Project
Create a Haskell project using cabal init. Add a main executable that outputs "Hello, Cabal!".

## HC14T2: Add Dependency and Print Random Number
Modify the .cabal file to include a dependency on the random package and print a random number between 1 and 100.

## HC14T3: NumericUnderscores Extension
Enable the NumericUnderscores extension. Create variables with large numbers and print them.

## HC14T4: TypeApplications Extension
Enable the TypeApplications extension and create a function that reads a String and converts it to an Int using read.

## HC14T5: Custom Data Type and Pattern Matching with @
Write a Haskell program that uses a custom data type Result a and demonstrate pattern matching using the @ symbol.

## HC14T6: Project Structure: src and app
Create a cabal project structure with src and app directories. Place the main module in the app folder and additional modules in src.

## HC14T7: Library Component in Cabal
Modify the .cabal file to support a library component alongside the main executable.

## HC14T8: Character Frequency Function
Implement a function counts that returns a list of tuples showing character frequency in a string.

## HC14T9: PartialTypeSignatures Extension
Use the language extension PartialTypeSignatures to allow wildcard types in a function signature.

## HC14T10: Cabal Test Suite
Write a cabal test suite for a module that verifies correct behavior of the counts function.
