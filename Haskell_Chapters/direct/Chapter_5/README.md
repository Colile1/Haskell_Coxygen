Haskell Chapter 5 Practical Tasks: Improving and Combining Functions

## HC5T1: Using applyTwice
Define a function that takes a function and an integer, then applies the function three times to the integer.

## HC5T2: Filtering Odd Numbers
Use the filter function to extract all odd numbers from a given list of integers from 1 to 30.

## HC5T3: Checking for Uppercase Letters
Write a function using any that checks if a list of words contains any word that starts with an uppercase letter.

## HC5T4: Using Lambda Functions
Rewrite the following function using a lambda function:
biggerThan10 x = x > 10

## HC5T5: Partial Application
Create a function multiplyByFive that uses partial application to multiply any number by 5.

## HC5T6: Function Composition
Use function composition (.) to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns their squares filtered to only keep the even ones.

## HC5T7: The $ Operator
Rewrite the following function using the $ operator:
result = sum (map (*2) (filter (>3) [1..10]))

## HC5T8: Point-Free Style
Convert the following function to point-free style:
addFive x = x + 5

## HC5T9: Higher-Order Function to Transform a List
Write a higher-order function transformList that applies a given function twice to every element of a list.

## HC5T10: Combining Higher-Order Functions
Combine filter, map, and any to create a function that checks if any squared value in a list is greater than 50.
