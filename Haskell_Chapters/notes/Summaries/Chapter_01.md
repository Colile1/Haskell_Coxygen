# Chapter 1: Introduction to Haskell - Summary

## Key Concepts

### Haskell Basics
- Haskell is a functional programming language.
- Pure functions, immutable data.
- Lazy evaluation.
- Strong static typing.

### Expressions and Evaluation
- Expressions are evaluated to values.
- Use GHCI for interactive evaluation.
- Basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /, ^, etc.
- Parentheses for grouping.

### Functions
- Functions are defined with name, parameters, body.
- Example: `add x y = x + y`
- Functions are first-class citizens.
- Apply functions with spaces: `add 3 4`

### GHCI Commands
- `:load` or `:l` to load files.
- `:reload` or `:r` to reload.
- `:type` or `:t` to check types.
- `:quit` or `:q` to exit.

### Basic Types
- Int: integers.
- Double: floating point.
- Bool: True/False.
- Char: characters.
- String: strings.

### Lists and Tuples
- Lists: homogeneous, variable length.
- Tuples: heterogeneous, fixed length.

## Quick Revision Tips
- Haskell is functional and pure.
- Expressions evaluate to values.
- Functions defined with =.
- Use GHCI for testing.
- Types restrict usage.
- Lists with [], tuples with ().
