This topic focuses on creating non-parameterized types in Haskell, building on prior knowledge of what types are and why they are useful.It begins with type synonyms, explaining how to define them and why they improve code readability and maintainability. Next, it introduces new types using the data keyword, detailing how to create and use custom types effectively. The concept of value parameters is explored, showing how types can hold specific values. Finally, record syntax is introduced as a convenient way to define structured data with named fields, enhancing code clarity and accessibility. By the end of this lesson, developers will have a solid foundation for defining their own types, enabling better organization and abstraction in their Haskell programs.
